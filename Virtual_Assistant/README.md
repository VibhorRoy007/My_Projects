This C++ code creates a simple Virtual Assistant for Windows, named "Vibhor." It offers features like showing time, checking weather, providing system status, a basic calculator, file explorer access, entertainment (jokes/quotes), a timer, reminder management, and playing music via YouTube.

Features
Time Display: Shows the current time.
Weather Information: Fetches weather details for a specified city using wttr.in.
System Status: Displays memory usage, battery status, and free disk space.
Calculator: Performs basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /).
File Explorer: Opens the Windows File Explorer.
Entertainment: Tells a random joke or motivational quote.
Timer: Sets a countdown timer with an audible notification.
Reminders: Allows users to add and view text-based reminders, saved to a file (reminders.txt).
Play Music: Opens a web browser to search and play songs on YouTube.
Speech Output: Uses espeak for voice feedback.
Typed Output: Simulates typing effect in the console.
Prerequisites
Before compiling and running the assistant, ensure you have the following installed:

C++ Compiler: A C++ compiler like MinGW (GCC) or MSVC (from Visual Studio) is required.
espeak: This is used for text-to-speech. Download and install it from http://espeak.sourceforge.net/. Make sure espeak.exe is in your system's PATH.
curl: Used to fetch weather data. Download the Windows version from https://curl.se/windows/ and add its directory to your system's PATH.
How to Compile and Run
Save the Code: Save the provided C++ code as assistant.cpp.

Open Command Prompt/Terminal: Navigate to the directory where you saved assistant.cpp.

Compile: Use a C++ compiler (e.g., g++ for MinGW) to compile the code. The winmm.lib library is needed for sound playback.

Bash

g++ assistant.cpp -o assistant.exe -lwinmm
If you are using Visual Studio, you can compile it within the IDE or using the MSVC compiler from the Developer Command Prompt:

Bash

cl assistant.cpp winmm.lib
Run: Execute the compiled program:

Bash

./assistant.exe
or simply

Bash

assistant.exe
Usage
When you run the program, it will first ask for an authorization password:
Password: Vibhor123

After successful authentication, you can type commands at the > prompt.

Available Commands:

time: Displays the current time.
weather: Prompts for a city name and shows its current weather.
status: Provides system information (memory, battery, disk space).
calculator: Allows you to enter simple arithmetic expressions (e.g., 2 + 3).
files: Opens Windows File Explorer.
entertain me: Tells a joke or a motivational quote.
timer: Asks for a duration in minutes to set a countdown timer.
reminders: Provides options to add or view reminders.
play music: Prompts for a song name and opens a Youtube in your browser.
help: Displays a list of all available commands.
exit or bye: Quits the assistant.
Important Notes
espeak and curl in PATH: Ensure that the executables for espeak and curl are accessible from your system's PATH environment variable. Otherwise, the voice output and weather features will not work.
Internet Connection: The weather and music playback features require an active internet connection.
Security: The password Vibhor123 is hardcoded in the program. For a real-world application, this should be handled more securely (e.g., hashed passwords, external configuration).
Error Handling: The program has basic error handling for inputs and external commands, but it might not cover all edge cases.
